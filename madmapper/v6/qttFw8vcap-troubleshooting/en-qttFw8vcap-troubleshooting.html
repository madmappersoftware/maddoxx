<h4>I can&rsquo;t find MadAI in MadMapper</h4>
<p>Make sure you are using MadMapper version 5.7 or later, and you are logged into MadMapper with the correct account.</p>
<p>To access MadAI:</p>
<ul>
<li>In MadMapper, go to the bottom panel</li>
<li>Open the Tools section</li>
<li>Find AI / Code Editor in the list</li>
<li>Click the + (plus) button &rarr; Select New Material</li>
<li>Make sure "Using MadAI" is checked</li>
</ul>
<p>If the option is still missing, try restarting MadMapper or reinstalling the latest version supported by your license.</p>
<h4>MadMapper says the material name is already in use, but I&rsquo;ve deleted it</h4>
<p>This is a known behavior. Simply choose a different material name, even if the previous one was deleted. The name may still be cached.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you connected to the internet?</li>

<li>Do you have any firewalls or security software that could be blocking access? Try temporarily disabling them or whitelisting MadMapper</li>
</ul>
