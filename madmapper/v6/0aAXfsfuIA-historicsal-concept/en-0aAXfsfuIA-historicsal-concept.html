<h3 id="ancientbeginningslightandshadow">Ancient Beginnings: Light and Shadow</h3>
<p>The story of video mapping begins in the darkness of prehistoric caves. Our ancestors discovered that <strong>fire could cast shadows on cave walls</strong>, creating the first immersive visual experiences. These early humans painted on uneven rock surfaces, understanding intuitively how light and surface texture could enhance storytelling.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks later developed the <strong>camera obscura</strong>, a dark chamber where light passing through a small hole projected images of the outside world onto walls. This principle laid the groundwork for all future projection technologies.</p>
<h3 id="themagiclanternera">The Magic Lantern Era</h3>
<p>In the 17th century, inventors created the <strong>magic lantern</strong> - essentially the first slide projector. This device used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil lamps or candles as light sources</li>
<li>Hand-painted glass slides</li>
<li>Simple lens systems to focus images</li>
</ul>
<p>Magic lanterns became popular entertainment, projecting stories and educational content onto walls and screens in public halls and homes.</p>
<h3 id="photographymeetsprojection">Photography Meets Projection</h3>
<p>The 19th century brought revolutionary changes with the invention of photography. Suddenly, <strong>realistic images could be captured and projected</strong>. The development of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photographic slides</strong> replaced hand-painted glass</li>
<li><strong>Improved lighting systems</strong> using gas and later electricity</li>
<li><strong>Better lens technology</strong> for sharper, brighter images</li>
</ul>
<p>These advances made projection more practical and widespread.</p>
<h3 id="cinemasbirth">Cinema's Birth</h3>
<p>The late 1800s saw the convergence of projection and motion. Inventors like the <strong>Lumi&egrave;re Brothers</strong> combined rapid sequential photography with projection systems, creating the first movies. Their cinematograph could both record and project moving images, establishing the foundation of cinema.</p>
<h3 id="thefirstvideoprojectors">The First Video Projectors</h3>
<p>The transition from film to electronic projection began in the mid-20th century. Early video projectors evolved from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Television technology</strong> of the 1940s-50s</li>
<li><strong>Cathode ray tube (CRT) systems</strong> that could project TV signals</li>
<li><strong>Three-tube RGB projectors</strong> of the 1970s for better color reproduction</li>
</ul>
<p>These early video projectors were <strong>large, expensive, and primarily used in professional settings</strong> like planetariums and large auditoriums. They marked the beginning of what would eventually become modern video mapping - the ability to project dynamic, electronic content onto any surface.</p>
<p>This technological evolution set the stage for today's sophisticated mapping systems, where any surface can become a canvas for digital storytelling.</p>
