<h2 class="int-link-anchors">Credits</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>MadAI credits are required to make requests to MadAI Artificial Intelligence. You can purchase credits here: <a title="MadAI Credits" href="https://madmapper.com/extensions/madai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://madmapper.com/extensions/madai</a></p>
<p>The credits will be stored in your MadMapper account. Basically 1 credit = 1 prompt.</p>
<h4>Expiration</h4>
<p>Unused credits remain in your account until you use them. They don&rsquo;t expire!</p>
<h4>Prompts</h4>
<p>Basically 1 credit = 1 prompt. The quality level or style you choose does not affect credit usage. Even at maximum settings, 1 credit always equals 1 prompt.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
