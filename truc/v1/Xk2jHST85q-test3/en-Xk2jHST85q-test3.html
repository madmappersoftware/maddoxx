<h2 id="whatismadmapper">What is MadMapper?</h2>
<p>MadMapper is a professional video mapping software developed by GarageCUBE that allows artists, designers, and technicians to project visual content onto complex surfaces and objects. It transforms any surface into a dynamic canvas for creative expression through precise geometric calibration and real-time visual effects.</p>
<h2 id="keyfeaturesandcapabilities">Key Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3 id="surfacemapping">Surface Mapping</h3>
<p>MadMapper excels at <strong>surface mapping</strong>, which involves projecting images and videos onto irregular surfaces like buildings, sculptures, or stage designs. The software calculates the exact geometry needed to make flat digital content appear perfectly fitted to three-dimensional objects.</p>
<h3 id="realtimeperformance">Real-Time Performance</h3>
<p>The software is designed for <strong>live performances</strong> and installations, offering low-latency processing that makes it suitable for concerts, theater productions, and interactive exhibitions. You can manipulate visuals in real-time without noticeable delays.</p>
<h3 id="multiprojectorsupport">Multi-Projector Support</h3>
<p>MadMapper supports <strong>multiple projectors</strong> simultaneously, allowing you to create large-scale installations that span across various surfaces. The software handles edge blending and geometric correction across multiple projection sources.</p>

<h2 id="technicalworkflow">Technical Workflow</h2>
<h3 id="surfacecreation">Surface Creation</h3>
<p>The mapping process begins with <strong>surface creation</strong>, where you define the shape and position of your projection target. MadMapper provides tools to create quads, triangles, circles, and complex polygonal shapes that match your physical surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="contentassignment">Content Assignment</h3>
<p>Once surfaces are defined, you can assign <strong>various content types</strong> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video files</li>
<li>Live camera feeds</li>
<li>Generated patterns</li>
<li>Audio-reactive visuals</li>
<li>Interactive elements</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calibrationandalignment">Calibration and Alignment</h3>
<p>The software includes precise <strong>calibration tools</strong> to ensure your projected content aligns perfectly with physical surfaces. This involves adjusting corner points, applying perspective corrections, and fine-tuning geometric parameters.</p>
<h2 id="interfaceanduserexperience">Interface and User Experience</h2>
<h3 id="intuitivedesign">Intuitive Design</h3>
<p>MadMapper features a <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> that balances professional capabilities with accessibility. The workspace is organized logically, making it easier for both beginners and experienced users to navigate complex projects.</p>
<h3 id="modulararchitecture">Modular Architecture</h3>
<p>The software employs a <strong>modular approach</strong> where different components can be combined and configured according to project needs. This flexibility allows for both simple single-surface mappings and complex multi-element installations.</p>
<h2 id="industryrecognition">Industry Recognition</h2>
<p>MadMapper has become an <strong>industry standard</strong> in the projection mapping field, trusted by professionals worldwide for its reliability, precision, and creative possibilities. Its continuous development and active community support make it a leading choice for video mapping projects of all scales.</p>
