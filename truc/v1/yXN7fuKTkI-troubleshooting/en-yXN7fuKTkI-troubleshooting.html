<h2 class="int-link-anchors">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Startup</h3>
<p>After being power-on, the MiniMad will boot and display the &ldquo;mad&rdquo; logo for 30 to 60 seconds before starting the media playback. If the mad logo doesn&rsquo;t appear, please refer to the RESTORE THE SD-CARD section. Using MiniMad Light, if the sequence doesn&rsquo;t start playing after the boot sequence, first check the MiniMad LEDs and refer to the LED STATUS section, then plug the MiniMad to a HDMI display to get more info and feedback.</p>
<h3>LED Status</h3>
<h4>Red</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3">The red LED should always be static when powered and running.</li>
<li class="p3">The red LED blinking rapidly means the MiniMad requires activation: plug your MiniMad onto a HDMI display and follow the on-screen procedure. (cf. ACTIVATE YOUR MiniMad SD-CARD).</li>
<li class="p3">The red LED blinking slowly or randomly means the MiniMad doesn&rsquo;t get enough current from the power-supply: please make sure you use the official power-supply provided with the MiniMad, and that the connector is not damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Green</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3">The green LED blinks when accessing the SD-card.</li>
<li class="p3">The green LED should start blinking rapidely right after the MiniMad has been powered on.</li>
<li class="p3">If the green LED is not blinking at startup, you can start by cleaning the SD-card pins using a soft tissue, and make sure there&rsquo;s no dust preventing the internal SD-card reader to access the SD-card by blowing in the reader&rsquo;s cutout.</li>
<li class="p3">When shutting down using the embedded buttons, USB keyboard, MiniMad Controller or the dedicated OSC command, the green LED will blink 6 successive times to indicate the device can be electrically powered-off.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restore the SD-card</h3>
<p class="p3">If you experience difficulties with your MiniMad, the first thing to do is to restore your SD card by following&nbsp;the procedure detailed in the Getting started / Quick start section.</p>
<p class="p3">The MiniMad image disk is huge - if the downloaded file doesn&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s mostly due to a download fail&nbsp;at some point, you&rsquo;ll have to download the image disk again.</p>
<p class="p3">By the way, always prefer the SD-card which comes with the MiniMad unit and above all avoid cheap&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p class="p3">Plus, if after flashing the SD-card your MiniMad fails to start, it&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s some dusk stuck in&nbsp;the unit SD-card reader - you can try removing the card and blowing air in the slot to clean it.</p>
<p class="p3">Also make sure you are using the latest version of MadMapper available in&nbsp;<span class="s1">MadMapper Downloads</span>.</p>
