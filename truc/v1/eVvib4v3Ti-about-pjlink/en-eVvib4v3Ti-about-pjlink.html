<h3>What is PJLink?</h3>
<p data-start="157" data-end="498"><strong data-start="157" data-end="167">PJLink</strong> is an open protocol standard designed for the <strong data-start="214" data-end="261">remote control and monitoring of projectors</strong> over a network. Developed by the <strong data-start="295" data-end="375">Japan Business Machine and Information System Industries Association (JBMIA)</strong>, PJLink provides a unified method of communication between projectors and control systems, regardless of the manufacturer.</p>
<p data-start="500" data-end="852">The primary goal of PJLink is <strong data-start="530" data-end="550">interoperability</strong>. By adhering to this standard, devices from different brands (like Panasonic, NEC, Epson, Sony, etc.) can be controlled using the same set of commands. This greatly simplifies integration in environments with mixed hardware &mdash; such as schools, conference centers, auditoriums, or digital installations.</p>
<p data-start="854" data-end="1087">PJLink operates over <strong data-start="875" data-end="885">TCP/IP</strong>, typically on <strong data-start="900" data-end="913">port 4352</strong>, and supports a range of commands to control power, input sources, AV mute, lamp status, and error reporting. It also includes a basic authentication mechanism for security.</p>

<h3>About projectors</h3>
<p data-start="189" data-end="493">A <strong data-start="191" data-end="204">projector</strong> is an electronic device that receives video signals and displays images or videos by projecting them onto a surface, typically a screen or wall. Projectors are widely used in various settings &mdash; from home theaters and classrooms to conference rooms, museums, and large-scale installations.</p>
<p data-start="495" data-end="576">There are several types of projectors, each using different imaging technologies:</p>
<ul data-start="578" data-end="1098">
<li data-start="578" data-end="700">
<p data-start="580" data-end="700"><strong data-start="580" data-end="612">LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)</strong>: Offers good color reproduction and sharpness; commonly used in business and education.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="701" data-end="836">
<p data-start="703" data-end="836"><strong data-start="703" data-end="737">DLP (Digital Light Processing)</strong>: Known for high contrast ratios and smoother video; widely used in cinema and portable projectors.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="837" data-end="964">
<p data-start="839" data-end="964"><strong data-start="839" data-end="875">LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon)</strong>: Combines advantages of LCD and DLP; used in high-end models for detailed image quality.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="965" data-end="1098">
<p data-start="967" data-end="1098"><strong data-start="967" data-end="993">Laser &amp; LED Projectors</strong>: Use solid-state light sources for longer lifespans, lower maintenance, and instant on/off capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1100" data-end="1142">Key features of modern projectors include:</p>
<ul data-start="1143" data-end="1380">
<li data-start="1143" data-end="1177">
<p data-start="1145" data-end="1177"><strong data-start="1145" data-end="1159">Resolution</strong> (e.g., 1080p, 4K)</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1178" data-end="1215">
<p data-start="1180" data-end="1215"><strong data-start="1180" data-end="1194">Brightness</strong> (measured in lumens)</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1216" data-end="1271">
<p data-start="1218" data-end="1271"><strong data-start="1218" data-end="1233">Throw Ratio</strong> (distance-to-image size relationship)</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1272" data-end="1332">
<p data-start="1274" data-end="1332"><strong data-start="1274" data-end="1310">Keystone Correction &amp; Lens Shift</strong> (for image alignment)</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1333" data-end="1380">
<p data-start="1335" data-end="1380"><strong data-start="1335" data-end="1351">Connectivity</strong> (HDMI, VGA, USB, LAN, Wi-Fi)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1382" data-end="1638">Many projectors today also support <strong data-start="1417" data-end="1436">network control</strong>, allowing remote operation, monitoring, and automation. This is where protocols like <strong data-start="1522" data-end="1532">PJLink</strong> come in &mdash; offering a standardized way to manage projectors across different brands from a central system.</p>
<p data-start="1640" data-end="1789">In professional environments, projectors are often integrated into AV control systems for seamless presentations, signage, and immersive experiences.</p>
