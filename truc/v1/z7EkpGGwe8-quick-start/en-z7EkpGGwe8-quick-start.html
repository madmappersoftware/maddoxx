<p>General</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">MiniMad is an all-in-one dedicated media playback device for video and LED mapping, based&nbsp;on the Raspberry Pi platform.&nbsp;Easy to use, small and versatile, it can be a good replacement for a computer in your future&nbsp;audiovisual installation.</p>
<p class="p1">The MiniMad works with a SD-card that contains both the system and the software of the&nbsp;MiniMad.&nbsp;The MiniMad system can be updated or reinstalled if needed, by following the procedure&nbsp;described in the chapter called &ldquo;Flash your MiniMad SD-card&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p1">The MiniMad software is getting automatically updated when exporting from an updated&nbsp;version of Mad- Mapper.</p>
<p class="p1">MiniMad can either be installed with MiniMad Video to play video-mapping, or with MiniMad&nbsp;Light to play recorded DMX sequences.</p>
<p class="p1">Note that MiniMad Video and MiniMad Light cannot be installed at the same time on the same&nbsp;MiniMad.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, the SD-card must be activated for each new MiniMad it is used into.&nbsp;The SD-card is already activated in any brand new MiniMad.&nbsp;If you want to use a SD-card other than the one the MiniMad shipped with, please make sure&nbsp;to flash the latest system by following the chapter called &ldquo;Flash your MiniMad SD-card&rdquo; prior to</p>
<p class="p1">activate it.&nbsp;At export time, MadMapper will remind you to activate when trying to export to a SD-card that</p>
<p class="p1">was not yet activated.</p>
