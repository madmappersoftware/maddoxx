<h4>MiniMad makes your installation easy and affordable.</h4>
<p>MiniMad is a dedicated plug-and-play device designed to work with MadMapper.</p>
<p>It hooks up to a projector and plays movie files on surfaces exported from MadMapper. Put your expensive and bulky computers out of a job.</p>
<h4>Small by size but feature rich</h4>
<p>With the tiny MiniMad, you export quad, triangle circle or mask surfaces as well as their content from a selected projector in MadMapper. Or you can switch the MiniMad to lighting mode and output DMX/Artnet channel data to your light fixtures.</p>
<h4>Discreet and Autonomous</h4>
<p>The MiniMad can run on its own for a very long time: we have one unit in the lab running for more than a year ! In case of a power failure, the MiniMad will automatically restart without any user intervention. All the mapping modifications you do are automatically saved on the SD-Card!</p>
<h4>Team Power</h4>
<p>Multiple MiniMads can be synchronized with each other over ethernet to make a cluster of synchronized video players. Zero configuration needed! MadMapper will automatically split movies and optimize files for playback!</p>
