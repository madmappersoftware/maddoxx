<p class="p1">In Advanced tab, you can also specify a nickname for the the Bonjour OSC Discovery, or disable it&nbsp;completely to prevent the MiniMad from appearing in applications supporting Bonjour.&nbsp;(cf CONTROLS / OSC section for more details)</p>
<p class="p1">You can reset all of the export settings to default by clicking &ldquo;Load Default Settings&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">To connect remotely, your MiniMad must be powered on and connected to the same local ethernet network as MadMapper, or even through a VPN connection.</p>
<p class="p1">In MadMapper, you can either select your MiniMad in the list of MiniMad units found on the network using&nbsp;Bonjour, or connect manually by entering the MiniMad&rsquo;s hostname or IP address (if you chose to disable&nbsp;Bonjour in a prior MiniMad export, or you want to connect to the MiniMad through a VPN for instance).</p>
<p class="p1">When selecting a remote MiniMad, MadMapper may inform you that your MiniMad operating-system is&nbsp;not yet compatible with remote export. In this case, you would need to flash your MiniMad SD-card using&nbsp;the latest MiniMad Disk Image in order to export to the MiniMad remotely.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The whole flashing procedure is detailed in the dedicated section &ldquo;UPDATE YOUR MINIMAD SD-CARD&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p1">If necessary, MadMapper will update the MiniMad Light application automatically prior to export.</p>
<p class="p1">Once the SD-card is ready, click Export to export selected sequences to the SD-card.</p>
<p class="p1">Once exported, the SD-card should be automatically ejected so you can directly stick it in your MiniMad.</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<p class="p1">MiniMad can either play audio through its audio mini-jack connector, or through an external USB&nbsp;system-compliant audio device, enabling the MiniMad to play audio file with as many channels as your&nbsp;device provides, in addition to an enhanced audio quality.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure to plug the audio USB device prior to powering the miniMAD on.</p>
<p class="p1">Note also that the MiniMad might not be able to provide enough USB-power to your device depending&nbsp;on its power consumption.</p>
<p class="p1">In this case please use an externally-powered USB hub in between the MiniMad and your device.</p>
