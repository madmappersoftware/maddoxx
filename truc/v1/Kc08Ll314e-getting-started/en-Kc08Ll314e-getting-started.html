<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div class="highText">
<p><br><strong>MadProjectorControl</strong> is a <strong>MadMapper</strong> paid extension using the PJLink protocol to remotely&nbsp;control any number of video projectors.</p>
<p><a href="https://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">https://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Totally cueable, this extension allows to schedule and automate power and shutter activity. You can therefore remotely power your PJLink-enabled projectors&nbsp;on and off, as well as mute their video and audio signal at will.&nbsp;Then, with the help of <strong>MadMapper</strong>&rsquo;s Calendar Scheduler &amp; Cue Scheduler, you can fully automate your installation, removing the need for a dedicated operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once purchased, <strong>MadProjectorControl</strong> can be installed on any <strong>MadMapper</strong> 5 (and above) system.</p>

<p class="p1">Please note that this guideline cannot cover an essential part: <strong>the network setup of your </strong><strong>projector</strong>. While the use of <strong>MadMapper</strong> and the <strong>PJLink</strong> protocol remain the same, the projector setup varies from one model to another, from one brand to another. Be aware that this step can be complicated if you are not initiated!</p>
