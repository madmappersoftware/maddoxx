<h2 class="int-link-anchors">MiniMad FAQ</h2>
<h4>Can I control the MiniMad from MadMapper ?</h4>
<p>You can individually control any number of MiniMad connected to the network with the MiniMad Control Module (Modules Tab).</p>
<h4>Can I control the MiniMad with a MIDI controller?</h4>
<p>MiniMad supports the MicroModul8 MIDI controller only, in addition to buttons, usb/wireless keyboard, OSC and the MiniMad controller module. We might have plans for universal MIDI support for the MiniMad in the future, stay tuned.</p>
<h4>Can I output to multiple projectors with the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>The MiniMad has a single HDMI output so it can output to only one projector. Which means one MiniMad is required for each projector. Multiple MiniMad units will automatically synchronize themselves when connected to the same ethernet network.</p>
<h4>Can I playback video and light at the same time from one MiniMad unit?</h4>
<p>You currently can&rsquo;t playback video AND light at the same time from one MiniMad, you would have to use different units.</p>
<h4>Can I replace MadMapper with a MiniMad?</h4>
<p>The MiniMad is essentially an advanced media player. So it is not intended to replace MadMapper and its more advanced features requiring the performances of a proper computer.</p>
<h4>Can I use several SD cards with the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>You can activate several SD cards for the same MiniMad and export different content on each one. It's then just a matter of changing the current card. Remark: If you buy your own SD-cards, make sure they're at least the same size as the MiniMad&rsquo;s original one; make sure as well you don't get &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; ones. Also please note that each new SD-Card must be physically activated for each different MiniMad unit, pressing the Red/Yellow/Blue buttons successively when the LED is blinking in red.</p>
<h4>Can I use soft-edge (edge blending) with the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>The MiniMad doesn't do soft-edge / edge blending but it can play many video outputs in sync. Soft-edge requires MadMapper and a computer with all the video-outputs running from the same graphics-adapter (GPU) to ensure perfect time synchronization.</p>
<h4>Can I use the MiniMad for my project?</h4>
<p>MiniMad is a perfect companion to MadMapper, however running on a Raspberry Pi it can't totally replace it. We invite you to learn more about the device&rsquo;s features through the website or the PDF guide.</p>
<h4>Do I need MadMapper to use the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>MadMapper is indeed required to export a video or a light mapping to the MiniMad&rsquo;s SD card. Once exported, the MiniMad will playback your content autonomously.</p>
<h4>Do I need to activate my purchased MiniMad?</h4>
<p>When you buy a MiniMad, the unit is already activated. However, if for instance you change your SD card you will need to reactivate your MiniMad at startup with the buttons.</p>
<h4>For how long can I run the MiniMad without rebooting it ?</h4>
<p>The MiniMad, if running on an Industrial Grade SD card and well aired, should run a very long time. We&rsquo;ve had units running for more than a year in suitable environments.</p>
<h4>How many DMX channels are supported by the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>You can playback up to 64 DMX universes with the MiniMad. Which corresponds to 32 768 channels.</p>
<h4>How many MadMapper licenses do I need to use multiple MiniMad units?</h4>
<p>You only need one MadMapper license to use as many MiniMad as you want. Exporting mapping projects to the MiniMad's SD card is unlimited.</p>
<h4>How will the MiniMad behave after a power cut?</h4>
<p>The MiniMad does support power cuts and failures, it will restart by itself once the power is back.<br>However, we advise to make a clone of your SD-card(s) in case a data corruption happens that could prevent the MiniMad from starting.</p>
<h4>What are the technical specifications of the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>Raspberry Pi 2, 7 buttons control panel, HDMI output up to 1080p (1920x1080 at 60Hz), size 9 x 6 x 3 cm (approx. 3.5 x 2.3 x 1.2 inches).</p>
<h4>What is the largest video size file that can be played by the MiniMad?</h4>
<p>There is no duration limit for your video files but they will not be able to exceed a size of 4GB (the maximal size of a file on a FAT32 partition) for a 16GB/32GB SD-card.</p>
<h4>What is the recommend codec for MiniMad videos?</h4>
<p>H264 and HAP are recommend. Please note that 1) MadMapper will take care of transcoding when exporting to MiniMad, 2) advanced settings are available in the Export window, 3) if you&rsquo;re not satisfied with your results, re-export your project by loading default export settings.</p>
<h4>Why would I need an Industrial Grade SD-card?</h4>
<p>In some situations where space is limited, the MiniMad units might get hot. If too hot for a long time, data corruption may appear on entry level SD-card. In these situations we advise you to use an Industrial/Military grade SD card. Such cards will allow you to run your installation for a very long time.</p>
